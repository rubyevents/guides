# Running Ruby Meetups

A practical guide for starting and sustaining a local Ruby meetup — from finding your first venue to keeping it going years later.

{% include toc.html variant="toc--mobile" heading="Contents" %}

## Why Bother

Ruby is more than a programming language - it's a community. Meetups are what keep that community alive. An active meetup scene produces the people who later travel to conferences, give talks, and build open source.

A local meetup is where a junior developer gets inspired. It's where someone lands a job because they had the right conversation. It's where someone stuck on a bad project hears a talk that finally cracks the thing they've been fighting for weeks.

None of that happens online. You do not need a big reason to start a meetup - you just need to want one to exist.

## Starting From Zero

The first meetup is the hardest. You have no experience and no idea if anyone will show up.

It's fine, we've all been there. Do the minimum that gets some Rubyists into a room, and worry about everything else later.

### Your first venue

Secure a venue for a specific date. Without a place to meet, there can be no meetup.

The best first venue for a tech meetup is often an office. Many companies have meeting rooms and common spaces sitting empty in the evenings. A Ruby shop is the obvious first call, but any tech company with a suitable space works. They get their name mentioned to a room full of developers and you get a free room.

Universities, co-working spaces - or even bars or bakeries - are other options. All you need is enough chairs, somewhere to plug in a laptop, and ideally a wall or screen to project on.

  content="When I started these meetups, my first call was to one of my former employers. They are a Ruby shop, and I knew they had a pretty nice meeting room."
%}

### Create an event

Once you have a venue, pick a date and put up an event listing. It needs only the basics - the date, time, location, and a sentence or two about what the meetup is. You can add speakers and program details as they are confirmed.

{% capture event_hosting_tip %}
When choosing an event hosting platform, there's really only two options.

**[Luma](https://luma.com/)** is lightweight and works well when you already know how you will promote the event. **[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/home/)** costs money, but can help people who search for local groups discover you.

Do not expect these platforms to promote the event for you. They will not.
{% endcapture %}
{% include tip.html type="tools" description=event_hosting_tip %}

### Get the word out

For the first event, promotion is simple. Just tell everyone you know! Email and text the Rubyists in your contacts. Message colleagues and former colleagues who write Ruby. Post in whatever Slack, Discord, or social channel your local community already uses.

That is enough for starters. The systematic side of getting people through the door comes later, once the meetup is a recurring thing.

### Five people is fine

The first event will probably be small. That's fine - it's a first event. Some of the best ongoing meetups started with a handful of people. What matters is that the people who came had a decent time and would come again.

Don't measure the first event against a full room. You created something that didn't exist before, and people showed up and connected because of you!

## Your Format

Every meetup is different - there is no format to rule them all. Find something that works for the specific group of people who show up in your specific region.

That said, some formats are more common than others.

### Talks

The most common meetup format is two or three talks, followed by — or interspersed with — time for people to hang out and talk to each other. It works because talks give people something to react to. They create shared context that makes starting conversations easier. "What did you think of that talk?" is a much lower-stakes opening than "So, what do you work on?"

For talk length, shorter is almost always better. A talk that runs long eats into the time people came for: seeing each other and talking.

Talks may be the reason people come to the meetup, but the conversations are the reason they come back.

### Alternatives

A **hack night** where people bring projects to work on and help each other. This works well for communities where developers already know each other well enough to be comfortable working alongside strangers. It is harder to run cold, because newcomers don't know what to work on or who to ask for help, but it can be a great change of pace for a group that's been running a while and wants variety.

A **workshop** where one person leads a hands-on exercise. This requires more preparation assumes attendees have laptops and - most importantly - a willingness to code with others. It's great when it lands, but harder to run than the alternatives.

A **hangout** puts the focus on the community and nothing else. No talks, no workshops, no pressure - just drinks, food, and conversation.

## Promotion

If you have a meetup and nobody is around to hear about it, are you actually having a meetup?

Promotion isn't most developers' idea of fun. The good news is that meetup promotion is mostly unglamorous, repeatable work - not clever marketing.

### Invite people personally

The single most effective thing you can do is invite people directly. A message from a real person - "we're running a Ruby meetup on the 14th, you should come" - lands in a way no public post does. It says the event is worth showing up to, from someone who would know.

Go through LinkedIn and find Ruby developers in your city. Start with your own network - if you're thinking of starting a Ruby meetup, you almost certainly already know someone local. Reach out to them first. It's time-consuming, but it's the most reliable way to fill a first or second event.

### Just keep posting

Public posts still matter. You just have to accept that most people will see one of them, not all. Post when you open sign-ups and post when you confirm a speaker. Post the week of the event, and again the day of. It feels repetitive to you - it's not for everyone else.

Target places where your local community already gathers, for example Slack, Discord, regional Ruby groups or social media.

### Consistency

A meetup that happens every second month on the third Tuesday becomes a fixture. People know when it is and plan around it. They might even bring someone new!

A meetup that happens sporadically, never becomes a habit for anyone and the group never builds momentum.

Pick a cadence - monthly is most common, but bi-monthly or even quarterly works too - and hold to it. Even when a given month is inconvenient, try to run something anyway. A small event beats no event at all.

### Word of mouth

After six to twelve months of consistent events, promotion takes less effort. People mention the meetup when a colleague asks where to meet other Rubyists - the word spreads.

You cannot speed this up. It happens because the meetup is fun and the people who go want others to go too. The only way there is to run good events consistently and wait.

## Speakers & Talks

Getting speakers for a local meetup is less daunting than it seems, but it takes active effort. Sometimes volunteers appear on their own - just don't count on it.

### Ask directly

The best way to get speakers is to find someone who has been working on something interesting and send them a message. Not a general "Anyone want to speak?", but a direct: "I think what you've been building with Hotwire would make a great talk. Would you be up for it?"

Someone who has never given a talk before will say yes far more readily to a specific invitation than to an open call. They know you want to hear about their thing in particular.

### Lightning talks

A ten-to-fifteen-minute talk is approachable for a first-time speaker. They don't have to fill forty minutes. They can show something they built, walk through a problem they solved, or share a technique they've been using.

Short talks also fit more speakers per event, which means more people get the experience of speaking in front of a room. Speakers who start at meetups often go on to give conference talks. Your meetup is the first rung.

## Money & Sponsors

Most meetups do not need much money. The venue is usually free, so the only real cost is food and drink - and even that is optional.

### Do you actually need sponsors?

Some meetups run with no budget at all. If you want to offer food and drink — which makes evenings more social and keeps people around longer — you will need either a small budget or a sponsor.

The most common model for meetup food is a single sponsor who covers pizza and soft drinks in exchange for a short mention or presentation at the start of the event. It's a clean exchange that has worked for decades. The most natural sponsors are the same people who host your venue. You find sponsors much the same way you find speakers or venues - look around your local circle for companies that fit, and reach out.

## Running the Event

The logistics of a meetup are not complicated, but the ones that go wrong tend to go wrong quietly — you don't notice until you're standing in front of thirty people and the projector won't connect.

### Projectors are evil

Bring an HDMI adapter, and a USB-C to HDMI adapter for good measure. Confirm before the event that the venue's projector or TV is accessible. Know where the input selector is and know how to turn up the volume. The question is not if you'll have AV problems - it's when.

If the venue has no projection setup, a large TV that speakers can connect to directly often works fine for a small room. Once you're over thirty people, some form of projection becomes necessary — people in the back can't see a laptop screen.

### Help people find you

Even a perfect description of the location won't stop people from getting lost. Be reachable if someone can't find their way. Keep a sheet of paper and a marker handy to point people in the right direction, and post photos of the entrance so people know what to look for. This matters most when the venue is inside an office building.

### Name tags

When a meetup is new and attendees don't know each other, name tags genuinely help. They let people approach strangers without the awkwardness of asking for a name they missed. They also give introverts a lower-friction way to read the room and decide who to talk to.

Once your meetup has a core of regulars who all know each other, name tags matter less. But in the beginning they do real work.

### Start on time

Start within ten minutes of the announced time, even if not everyone has arrived. People who showed up on time shouldn't be penalized for the people who didn't. Starting late just trains everyone to arrive late.

It's a small thing that signals that you are organized, you respect people's time, and the meetup is a real event.

---

## Building Culture

A meetup's culture is not what you write in the code of conduct. Culture is built by what is tolerated, what is celebrated, and what the organizer visibly cares about.

### Make the code of conduct real

Post your code of conduct somewhere visible. Mention it briefly at the start of the event — not the legalese. Just tell people what this community expects, and what to do if something unpleasant happens. People notice when an organizer takes this seriously.

### Welcome new people explicitly

At the start of each meetup, ask who is here for the first time and give those people a moment of recognition. Invite regulars to introduce themselves to newcomers. Make an effort to talk to newcomers specifically. It's a small thing that dramatically changes the experience for someone arriving alone.

A meetup where regulars only talk to each other is not welcoming, even if it is technically open.

### Model what you expect

The standards of the room come from what you model and what you permit. If you treat speakers with visible respect, attendees follow. If you shut down a dismissive comment in the Q&A, you signal what the community values. If you publicly thank the people who do the unglamorous work — booking the venue, buying the food, setting up chairs — you reinforce that those contributions matter.

You don't need a manifesto or an elaborate onboarding process. You need to show, consistently, what kind of room this is.

## Keeping It Fun

The hardest part of organizing a meetup is not the first event. It is the tenth, when the novelty has worn off, and you are tired, and you have to do it again.

### Burnout is real and predictable

Running a meetup on any frequency costs time and energy, no matter how much you enjoy it. The preparation, the back-and-forth with speakers and venues, the promotion, the evening itself — it adds up. Most organizers who burn out do so quietly. They skip one month, find a reason to skip another, and just like that the meetup stops happening.

The best prevention is to not organize the meetup alone.

{% include testimonial.html
  name="Hans Schnedlitz"
  content="For me, running the meetup every quarter is the perfect frequency. It gives me enough time to prepare, but is regular enough to become a sort of constant in Vienna. Doing it more often would burn me out, and doing it less often would just lead to it fizzling out I think."
%}

### Find a co-organizer

A co-organizer is not your assistant. They are someone equally invested in the meetup continuing, who can run it when you cannot. They share the cognitive load of remembering what needs to happen and when and they cover for you when you are sick, traveling, or just depleted.

Finding a co-organizer is easier if you look for one actively rather than waiting for someone to volunteer. Ask a regular who seems particularly engaged and offer to share the role explicitly rather than asking if they "want to help out".

### Mix it up

The surest way to keep going is to keep it interesting for yourself. Running the exact same evening on repeat is how it turns into a chore. So change something! Swap talks for a hack night, move to a new venue, add a seasonal twist. Showing up with a batch of Christmas cookies costs almost nothing and livens up the whole room.

If you're getting bored, it's likely the rest of the attendees are too. Keeping it fun for yourself is a great way to keep it fun for everyone else.

## Growing & Evolving

Most meetups that are doing well will, at some point, face the question of what comes next. These are good problems to have.

### When to grow and when not to

A meetup does not need to grow to succeed. A consistent twenty-person event in a city is worth more to the community than a hundred-person event that happens twice and stops. Chasing attendance numbers pushes you toward decisions — bigger venues, more marketing, more elaborate programming — that add overhead without adding value.

Grow when you are turning people away, when you've found a venue that supports more people at no extra cost, or when the community explicitly wants more. Don't try to grow to prove that you are succeeding.

### Connecting to the broader Ruby world

Your meetup does not exist in isolation. Ruby Central, which supports meetups and conferences globally, can connect you with other organizers, grant funding, and sponsor relationships. Joining the Ruby Central Slack and the Ruby meetup organizers' group gives you access to people who have already solved the problems you are running into.

Connecting with regional conference organizers is worth doing too. Many conferences — Rocky Mountain Ruby, Blue Ridge Ruby, Helvetic Ruby, Tropical on Rails — have explicit relationships with local meetup communities. They promote each other and share audiences. Some conferences have grown directly out of meetups. Irina Nazarova started a monthly Ruby meetup in San Francisco, which eventually became the foundation for SF Ruby Conference.

A meetup that stays connected to the broader Ruby community — through newsletters, Slack groups, conference cross-promotion, and relationships with other organizers — is less isolated when things get hard. And when things go well, that connection is how your local community becomes part of something larger.

  name="Irina Nazarova"
  content="I was running a monthly meetup, and I thought, well, we need this kind of extra event for the meetup to also, once in a while, become something bigger... something more noticeable."

### Handing it over

If you have been running a meetup for several years and are ready to stop, the best outcome is not for it to quietly die. It is for it to continue under someone else.

The most natural successor is someone who already cares about the meetup and knows how it works. The transition is easier if you have shared the organizing work rather than done everything yourself. Give someone responsibility for speaker coordination or venue booking for a few months before you hand over. By the time you step back, they will already know how the meetup works from the inside.

A meetup that has served a community for years deserves a real transition, not a slow fade.
